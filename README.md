# halesclouds

Very barebones website so I can easily identify clouds.

It's based off [Weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov/jetstream/cloudchart#myModalm7). I always kept this website open on my phone to identify clouds but the website is terrible so I made my own.

Typesafe application.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Deployed on [Vercel](http://vercel.com)
